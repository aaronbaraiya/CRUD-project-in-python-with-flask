# CRUD-project-in-python-with-flask
I developed a basic CRUD web application using Flask and Python. The main tasks included defining Flask routes for create, read, update, and delete operations, connecting these routes to a database, and verifying each function through local testing. No external APIs were used— all operations were handled through Flask routes and backend Python code
When you run `app.py`, Flask will automatically create the `employee.db` SQLite database
and initialize the `employees` table if it doesn’t already exist.
